About/Overview
The Monkey Sanctuary program is a tool that helps manage the monkeys housed in the sanctuary. It allows users to register new monkeys and put them into isolation, and move them to the appropriate enclosure after they have received medical attention. The program keeps track of the monkeys' name, species, sex, size, weight, age, and favorite food. It also provides the user with a list of monkeys currently housed in each enclosure and an alphabetical list of all monkeys in the sanctuary. The program ensures that no more monkeys are registered than can be accommodated in isolation.
